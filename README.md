# Interventions2015code
Code by participants in the 10-week Summer program of the School of Machines, Making and Make Believe, 2015 Berlin.  Everything here is public. You probably don't want to include personal data in the files you upload here.  Please make a folder with your name where you upload your code.  It's a good idea to avoid large files. Git is best for managing code (small text files). Images are currently ignored. We can enable images later if desired.
